A tool to easily manage Freifunk Gluon Routers. (WIP)

Discussion Thread: https://forum.freifunk.net/t/gluon-remote-tool/

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1. Install the Linux Package 'ssh-keygen'
2. clone the repository to anywhere you want
3. Edit the config/config.json file as your needs
```

### Running

A step by step series of how to run the App

Web:

```
Web isn't implemented yet.
```

Commandline:

```
Usage: npm start [options] [command]

SSH Key has to be a private one. It is used to connect to the Router which means that you have to have a private key for the Tool and the public one must be registered in the Router

Commands:

  changeName <ip> <ssh> [token] <newname>                       Change the Hostname of the router (no Formular support yet!)
  changeContact <ip> <ssh> [token] [ccode] <name> <email>       Change the Contact of the router (no Formular support yet!)
  changeGeo <ip> <ssh> [token] [ccode] <lat> <long> <altitude>  Change the Router Position (no Formular support yet!)
  MOL <ip> <ssh> <on/off>                                       Activate or deactivate Mesh on Lan
  MOW <ip> <ssh> <on/off>                                       Activate or deactivate Mesh on Wan
  help [cmd]                                                    display help for [cmd]

Options:

  -h, --help  output usage information

```
